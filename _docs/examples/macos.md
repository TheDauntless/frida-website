To setup Frida for macOS, you need to authorize Frida to use task_for_pid to access your target process.

If you run your Frida tool via the GUI with your local user (e.g. from Terminal.app), you will be prompted via taskgate to authorize the process.

You may also need to disable [System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899).
